I am a young geoscientist, a climate change consultant from World Bank (Poverty Reduction and Equity Group) and a Hongkonger passionate about **Earth Observation, Climate Risk** and **Sustainabiliy**. I am currently working on mapping social vulnerability of Pakistan using satellite data.

My research interests include disaster risk and cryosphere dynamics. More specifically, I am interested in applying remote sensing, geospatial data and machine learning to study **how climate change impacts global communities in the present and future**. I have also worked on [Open Data Cube project](https://datacube.remote-sensing.org/) in West Africa and currently studying in W√ºrzburg, Germany for [Applied Earth Observation and Geoanalysis](http://eagle-science.org/about/).

üõ∞Ô∏è The remote sensing data I have been using includes Landsat, MODIS, AVHRR, MODIS, VIIRS, SRTM, GRACE, Sentinel-1,2, and 5, using mostly the following tools:

* [**Python/ GDAL**](https://pinkychow1010.github.io/data-science.html)
* [**Google Earth Engine**](https://pinkychow1010.users.earthengine.app/)
* **GIS**
* **R**
